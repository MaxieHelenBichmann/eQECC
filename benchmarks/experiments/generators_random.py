"""Random benchmark generators for (non-)equivalent code pairs.

Every public entry point is a static method of one of the generator classes
below. Equivalence problems on two codes use pair generators with the shape

    <family>_codes_<method>(n, k, seed) -> tuple[Code, Code]

The LC-CSS property problem uses single-code generators with the shape

    <family>_code_<method>(n, k, seed) -> Code

``<family>`` is the code family the pair is drawn from (``stabilizer`` or
``css``) and ``<method>`` names the *construction* used to obtain the second
code of the pair. The classes carry no state; they only group the constructions
belonging to one decision problem.

Positive constructions are exact: the second code is obtained by applying a
transformation from the equivalence group, so the pair is equivalent by
construction. Negative constructions instead document the *certificate* they
use and raise :class:`RandomizeError` when no candidate carrying that
certificate is found inside the search budget. Methods ending in
``_candidate`` are deliberately uncertified;
callers must label their outputs with an exact backend before treating them as
negative.

The choice of method matters, and different methods are not interchangeable.
A certified negative is selected with respect to an invariant. It therefore
cannot estimate that invariant's rejection rate on an unconditioned population.
Runtime measurements remain valid for the explicitly named generated family,
but may be artificially easy for solvers that evaluate the certificate or a
correlated invariant.
