# ***E******Q***uivalence Checking for ***Q***uantum ***E***rror ***C***orrection **C**odes

This repository benchmarks different approaches to equivalence checking for quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) under different equivalence notions. It is part of the implementation for my Bachelor's thesis, "Automated Equivalence Checking of Stabilizer Codes", which contributes to [MQT QECC](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/qecc). The required infrastructure and code representation classes are taken from that project.

This README does not discuss the examined equivalence notions or their theoretical foundations in depth; those are covered in the thesis. References for the implemented algorithms are cited in the corresponding source files.

This repository is currently not intended to be installed as a package, or be a professionally polished replication package. Its final hybrid algorithms are contributed to [MQT QECC](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/qecc).

## Problems

The following problems are benchmarked. They are expressed using the repository's input representation for a QECC $C$: a binary symplectic stabilizer matrix $\text{S}(C) \in \mathbb{F}_2^{r \times 2n}$, or the parity-check matrices $\text{H}_x(C) \in \mathbb{F}_2^{r_x \times n}$ and $\text{H}_z(C) \in \mathbb{F}_2^{r_z \times n}$ when the code is CSS.

### Permutation Equivalence

- **PM-STB**: Are two given stabilizer codes $C$ and $C'$ equivalent up to a permutation of the physical qubits?

$$
\exists P \in \mathfrak{S}_n,\ \exists R \in \mathrm{GL}(r, \mathbb{F}_2):
\qquad
\text{S}(C') =
R \cdot \text{S}(C) \cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
P & 0 \\
0 & P
\end{bmatrix}
$$

- **PM-CSS**: Are two given CSS codes $C$ and $C'$ equivalent up to a permutation of the physical qubits?

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\exists P \in \mathfrak{S}_n,\quad
\exists R_x \in \mathrm{GL}(r_x, \mathbb{F}_2),\quad
\exists R_z \in \mathrm{GL}(r_z, \mathbb{F}_2): \\
&\text{H}_x(C') = R_x \text{H}_x(C) P \enspace \text{ and } \enspace\text{H}_z(C') = R_z \cdot \text{H}_z(C) \cdot P
\end{aligned}
$$

### Local-Clifford Equivalence

- **LC-STB**: Are two given stabilizer codes $C$ and $C'$ local-Clifford equivalent, meaning that they define the same codespace up to local Clifford gates on the output qubits?

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\exists Q =
\begin{bmatrix}
A & B \\
C & D
\end{bmatrix}
\in \text{Sp}(2n, \mathbb{F}_2), \quad
Q_i =
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{ii} & b_{ii} \\
c_{ii} & d_{ii}
\end{bmatrix}
\in \text{Sp}(2, \mathbb{F}_2), \quad
\exists R \in \mathrm{GL}(r, \mathbb{F}_2):\\
&\text{S}(C') = R \cdot \text{S}(C) \cdot Q
\end{aligned}
$$

- **LC-CSS**: Is a given stabilizer code $C$ local-Clifford equivalent to a CSS code?

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\exists C' \text{ with }
\enspace
\text{S}(C') =
\begin{bmatrix}
\text{H}_x(C') & 0 \\
0 & \text{H}_z(C')
\end{bmatrix}:\\
&\exists Q =
\begin{bmatrix}
A & B \\
C & D
\end{bmatrix}
\in \text{Sp}(2n, \mathbb{F}_2), \quad
Q_i =
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{ii} & b_{ii} \\
c_{ii} & d_{ii}
\end{bmatrix}
\in \text{Sp}(2, \mathbb{F}_2), \quad
\exists R \in \mathrm{GL}(r, \mathbb{F}_2):\\
&\text{S}(C') = R \cdot \text{S}(C) \cdot Q
\end{aligned}
$$

## Scope

Here, a benchmark measures the runtime of the Python algorithms on the expected workload: input codes $[[n,k,d]]$ with $n$ ranging from 2 to approximately 50, plus some larger structured cases.

This repository is not currently intended for detailed benchmarking or profiling analyses.[^1] The goal is to understand the algorithms' different complexity classes and make a more informed decision about the hybrid implementations.

Inputs are guaranteed to be valid, so the core algorithms do not need to verify basic validity conditions. Simple and more involved invariants for the different equivalence notions are collected separately.

[^1]: A future C++ implementation could support more rigorous benchmarks, but that is currently outside the scope of the thesis.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as a minimal local benchmark application.

## Running the benchmarks

Requires Linux or macOS with a C compiler and Python 3.13 or newer; Python 3.13
is the tested version in CI and for the paper replication package. The
compiler is needed because `pynauty` is built from source on these versions;
Windows is not supported by `pynauty` and by the benchmark supervision.
The project is managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Create the
environment with the exact locked dependencies first:

```bash
uv sync
```

This creates `.venv` from `uv.lock`. Every command below runs inside that
environment, either with `uv run <command>` or after `source .venv/bin/activate`.

The benchmark infrastructure has four layers:

- `benchmarks.experiments.run.run(...)` executes exactly one function call. The caller
  supplies the function, positional inputs, exact expected value, timeout, and
  memory limit. Its `RunResult` separately reports runtime, whether the result
  matched, timeout, memory exhaustion, and any other execution error.
- `benchmarks.experiments.statistics.run_statistics(...)` accepts an algorithm, a seeded
  generator, a master seed, number of seeds, and output file. It derives
  distinct seeds deterministically and appends one aggregate row, including a
  CSV header when the file is empty.
- `benchmarks.thesis.thesis_prototypes` is the user-facing CLI for random cases and
  prototype algorithms.
- `benchmarks.thesis.thesis_hybrids` and
  `benchmarks.thesis.thesis_invariants` own the
  structured hybrid and fixed invariant suites, respectively.

Run a random prototype benchmark from the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m benchmarks.thesis.thesis_prototypes \
  --algorithm pm_css_sat --nmin 5 --nmax 8 \
  --nr-seeds 10 --output results/pm_css_sat_random.csv
```

`--algorithm` is repeatable and accepts exact names, shell wildcards, or regular
expressions. `--nmin` and `--nmax` select the inclusive randomized parameter
range. Raw-case benchmarking has been removed.

Two optional resource guards are available:

- `--timeout` limits the execution time of each repeat in seconds.
- `--memory-limit` limits the memory available to each benchmark child process. Accepted forms include `4096M`, `32G`, and `16GiB`.

Common parameters include `--output`, `--seed`, `--nr-seeds`, and `--verbose`.
Statistics files are append-only, so separate invocations can intentionally
contribute rows to the same file. For example:

```bash
python3 -m benchmarks.thesis.thesis_prototypes \
  --algorithm pm_css_bruteforce --algorithm lc_stb_lse \
  --seed 69 --nmin 3 --nmax 12 --timeout 200 --verbose \
  --output results/prototypes.csv

python3 -m benchmarks.thesis.thesis_prototypes \
  --algorithm 'pm_css*' --memory-limit 4GiB \
  --output results/pm_css_random.csv

python3 -m benchmarks.thesis.thesis_hybrids \
  --nmin 2 --nmax 144 --nr-seeds 10 --verbose \
  --output results/hybrids.csv

python3 -m benchmarks.thesis.thesis_invariants \
  --family both --timeout 20 --memory-limit 512M --verbose \
  --output results/invariants.csv
```

Optionally, record a flamegraph for more detailed analysis:

On macOS, `py-spy` must be run with `sudo` so it can attach to the Python
process.

```bash
py-spy record \
  --format flamegraph \
  --output results/pm_css_matroid_flame.svg \
  -- python -m benchmarks.thesis.thesis_prototypes --algorithm pm_css_matroid \
     --nmin 10 --nmax 10 --nr-seeds 1 \
     --output results/pm_css_matroid_profile.csv
```

The Bash scripts have intentionally not yet been migrated to the new dedicated
entry points; this cleanup only changes the Python benchmark infrastructure.

### Tests

[![Tests](https://github.com/MaxieHelenBichmann/bm_qecc/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MaxieHelenBichmann/bm_qecc/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

The test suite is located in `tests/`. They include unit, regression and randomized tests. Some algorithm sections do not yet have comprehensive coverage.

```bash
uv run pytest
```

The linter, the formatter and the type checker for the replication package run
the same way; `ruff format` rewrites files in place, `ruff format --check` only
reports:

```bash
uv run ruff check
uv run ruff format
uv run mypy paper/
```

For reference, the complete suite took 527 seconds (8 minutes 47 seconds) in
the Python 3.13 development environment on 5 September 2026: 760 tests passed
and 41 optional-dependency or inapplicable-case tests were skipped. Most of
that wall time is spent in the exhaustive LC-CSS/KLS coverage.

### Dependencies

Apart from the Python dependencies declared in `pyproject.toml` and locked in `uv.lock`, the automorphism-group algorithm uses [GAP and Guava](https://docs.gap-system.org/pkg/guava/doc/manual.pdf), so a GAP executable and Guava's dependencies are required. Place the Guava dependencies in `bm_qecc/.gap` and set the path to the GAP executable before running this algorithm:

```bash
export GAP_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/gap
```

This approach is expected to be less efficient than the alternatives and is included primarily for comparative measurements.

### AI Transparency

While I used coding agents in my workflow, I kept that usage and especially AI-generated code to a minimum. 
It is limited to small/fine-grained library-specific functions, i.e. my helper functions calling certain library functions with some additional checks (see `_kernel_basis` or `_row_basis`). Broader-scope algorithms and algorithm components are written by me.  
Some basic tests are generated as well.
The only relevant files where I used AI more than that are the benchmark
infrastructure in `benchmarks/experiments/`, especially `run.py`,
`statistics.py`, and `utils.py`, plus `benchmarks/run_*.sh`, for infrastructure, resource
restrictions and instance generation (reviewed by me).
