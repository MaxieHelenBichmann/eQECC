    For each code, the following is done:
    1.) Construct a binary matroid M = (E, I) from the Hx and Hz of the CSS code, by treating the columns of Hx and Hz as the ground elements E and using linear dependence of the columns for I.
    2.) Extract the circuits of the matroids, which are the minimal non-empty dependent sets of columns of Hx and Hz.
    3.) Construct a graph G = (V, K) from the circuits, where V represents the ground set (color 1), circuits of Hx (color 2) and circuits of Hz (color 3). The circuits are connected to the ground elements they contain, and there are no connections between circuits.

    4.) Check for isomorphism of the resulting graphs for the two codes via canonical forms.

    This algorithm should be more efficient than the brute-force algorithm, since the number of circuits is typically much smaller than the number of permutations, BUT it is still not efficient in general since the number of circuits can be exponential in the size of the codes, and graph isomorphism is not known to be in P.
